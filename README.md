# Classifying Gene Expression Data

Train several neural network based classifiers on the [Toil TCGA, TARGET and GTEX expression datasets](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?host=https://toil.xenahubs.net)

To get started look at ingest.ipynb to wrangle the dataset and train.ipynb for a very simple fully connected neural net tumor/normal classifier.
